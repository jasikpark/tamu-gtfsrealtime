# tamu-gtfsrealtime

> attempt to consume the A&amp;M bus api and provide a gtfs-realtime compliant api

A&amp;M Spirit Bus API: [https://transport.tamu.edu/BusRoutesFeed/swagger/ui/index#!/Buses/Buses_GetBusesOnRoute_Mentor](https://transport.tamu.edu/BusRoutesFeed/swagger/ui/index#!/Buses/Buses_GetBusesOnRoute_Mentor)

## so my plan is

- [ ] work through the [rocket](https://rocket.rs) tutorial and documenation
- [ ] read through the [gtfs-realtime](https://github.com/google/transit/tree/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en) spec in its entirety
- [ ] learn how to write an application that polls the api once every ten seconds (with some added random variance)
- [ ] learn how to work with databases so that there can be a single worker that polls the Spirit Bus api every ten seconds for updated info, that enters that information in a database for consumption
- [ ] take what I have learned from the [rocket](https://rocket.rs) tutorial and create a gtfs-realtime server

## the program structure will be

- [ ] consume api from [A&amp;M bus api site](https://transport.tamu.edu/BusRoutesFeed/swagger/ui/index#!/Buses/Buses_GetBusesOnRoute_Mentor)
- [ ] store that in a clear, internal representation via meaningful rust structs
- [ ] create an api server that uses [rocket](https://rocket.rs) and serve that on a minimal vps
- [ ] implement a web-based administrative ui for the server
